AI-Based Tarot Readings via a Streamlit App

This is currently pretty quickly hacked together as a learning experience for streamlit and working with LLM models.

An experiment in techno-mysticism.

The code is rather ugly, and it's not too hard to break the app currently, but it's interesting to play with.

Currently hosted at [emilytarot.com](https://emilytarot.com), though I have a modest monthly budget set for the OpenAI
API.

Hopefully I'll get GPT-4 access soon, the results are much more compelling based on my minimal ChatGPT testing. This
video is what got me interested in building something with a LLM and a random thought about an AGI psychic led to this.

There are a few additional features I'd like to work out, and then perhaps I'll rewrite it as a serverless App with a
proper frontend -- streamlit has been great for POC work, but so far I dislike hosting it.
