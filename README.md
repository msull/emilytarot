AI-Based Tarot Readings via a Streamlit App-- an experiment in techno-mysticism.

This is currently pretty quickly hacked together as a learning experience for streamlit and working with LLM models.

The code is rather ugly, and it's not too hard to break the app currently, but it's interesting to play with.

Currently hosted at [emilytarot.com](https://emilytarot.com), though I have a modest monthly budget set for the OpenAI
API.

I've applied for, and I am hoping to gain GPT-4 access soon. The results are much more compelling based on my minimal
ChatGPT testing.

This video is what got me interested in building something with a LLM and a random thought about an AGI psychic led to
this particularl app.

There are a few additional features I'd like to work out, and then perhaps I'll rewrite it as a serverless App with a
proper frontend -- streamlit has been great for POC work, but so far I dislike hosting it.
